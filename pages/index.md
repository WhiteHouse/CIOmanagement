# FITARA Implementation

### Background

The Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act ([FITARA](https://www.congress.gov/113/plaws/publ291/PLAW-113publ291.pdf#page=148%5D)), passed by Congress in December 2014, is a historic law that represents the first major overhaul of Federal information Technology (IT) in almost 20 years. Since FITARA’s enactment, OMB published guidance to agencies to ensure that this law is applied consistently governmentwide in a way that is both workable and effective. This guidance is now available as OMB Memorandum [M-15-14: Management and Oversight of Federal Information Technology](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2015/m-15-14.pdf).

On this site you will find a number of resources related to FITARA implementation, including a self-assessment template, frequently asked questions, and an opportunity to interact with other agencies.
