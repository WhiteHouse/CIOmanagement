# Management and Oversight of Federal Information Technology

### Overview

On this site you will find a number of resources related to FITARA implementation, including a self-assessment template, frequently asked questions, example documents, and an opportunity to interact with other agencies. 


### Background

The Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act ([FITARA](https://www.congress.gov/113/plaws/publ291/PLAW-113publ291.pdf#page=148%5D)), passed by Congress in December 2014, is a historic law that represents the first major overhaul of Federal information Technology (IT) in almost 20 years. Since FITARAâ€™s enactment, OMB published guidance to agencies to ensure that this law is applied consistently governmentwide in a way that is both workable and effective. This guidance is now available as OMB Memorandum [M-15-14: Management and Oversight of Federal Information Technology](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2015/m-15-14.pdf).


### Implementation Guidance
